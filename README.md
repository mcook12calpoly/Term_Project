# Term Project - Plotting Machine

For this term project, a 2.5 axis plotting machine will be contructed using a pivoting arm driven by a motor attached to a wheel at the end of the arm. Alongside the arm with the motor will be a lead screw driven by a second motor which will move a pen carrier linearly along the arm. Within the pen carrier will be a servo attached to the pen to raise and lower the pen. The body of the arm will be made of square metal tubing and the pen chassis as well as the coupling piece to keep the pen carrier upright will be 3D printed. The pivoting mechanism for the arm will have a bearing to minimize slop in our rotation. The code will use kinematic calculations to convert the x,y plot directions to the curvilinear movement of the arm.
