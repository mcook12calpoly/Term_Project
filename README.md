# Term Project - Plotting Machine

For this term project, a 2.5 axis plotting machine will be contructed using a pivoting arm driven by a motor attached to a wheel at the end of the arm. Alongside the arm with the motor will be a lead screw driven by a second motor which will move a pen carrier linearly along the arm. Within the pen carrier will be a servo attached to the pen to raise and lower the pen. A small piece will be added near the tip of the pen to allow the servo arm to push it upwards. To keep tension on the pen as it is in its lower, writing position, a rubber band will be wrapped around the top of it. The body of the arm will be made of square metal tubing and the pen chassis as well as the coupling piece that connects the arm and carrier to keep the pen carrier upright will be 3D printed. The pivoting mechanism for the arm will have a bearing to minimize slop in our rotation. A limit switch will be used to signal when the arm is in its home position. The encoders included with them motors will be used to track the movement of the arm and determine the pen's location. The code will use kinematic calculations to convert the x,y plot directions to the curvilinear movement of the arm and pen carrier.
